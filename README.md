# Audio-Transcriber
This project provides a simple yet powerful Python script to transcribe audio files (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG) into text using OpenAI's highly accurate Whisper model. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy file selection and saves the transcribed text in a dedicated output directory.
